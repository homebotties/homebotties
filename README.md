### TODO (System)

- Mobile UI (tailwind ui?)
- lock down security better (no camera ui)
- Document configuring lights, camera, motors, lights, mic, rf
- start service in bg 
- Communicate w/ arduinos etc
- Version control system dependencies (rasbpian version, system packages, settings)

## LifeLog app todo
- record state
- access recordings
- flicker like a candle when on
- transmit ultrasonic FYIs

- joystick-style drive


### HOWTO

- Install on stock hardware (bare pi zero with no monitor), configure network, create accounts, run service
- Change hostname:
