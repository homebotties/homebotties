## Usage

Run your bot app by opening `https://homebot/` on your phone (when on the same wifi network)


# Hardware

- Any computer (even a chromebook is fine!), a phone (to run your bot app)
- Raspberry Pi 
  - Burn latest Raspian to SD card: https://www.raspberrypi.org/documentation/installation/installing-images/chromeos.md
  - Power on, connect (various phone or keyboard/mouse/screen solutions)
  - Configure wifi, set hostname to bot name (in our examples, we'll name our bot `homebot`, but this can be whatever you want)
  - Enable SSH, create keys, set up your normal terminal
  - Install Node (10?), make an LED blink...
